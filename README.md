Visual Data Exploration with Tableau

Heat Maps for Patterns: 
This technique enabled me to spot trends that might have been hidden in traditional tabular data.

Mapping for Spatial Understanding: 
Through mapping, I visualized geographical data, helping me identify location-based insights.

Histograms for Distribution Insights: 
I employed histograms to gain a deeper understanding of data distribution. This allowed me to identify central tendencies and variations in the data.

Line Charts for Trends: 
By creating line charts, I tracked trends and fluctuations over time. This visualization aided me in observing long-term patterns and making informed forecasts.

Calendar Views for Temporal Patterns: 
Leveraging calendar views, I examined temporal patterns and identified recurring trends or irregularities, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the data.

Completing the Tableau project expanded my visual analysis toolkit, equipping me with the ability to present complex data in clear and insightful ways.
